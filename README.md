# ðŸŒ¿ Plant Leaf Disease Detection using CNN

This is a deep learning-based image classification project that uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to detect diseases in plant leaves. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of diseased and healthy plant leaf images and is capable of multi-class classification.
